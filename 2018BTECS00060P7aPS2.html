<p>
In astronomy an astronomical object or celestial object is a naturally occurring physical entity, 
association, or structure that exists in the observable universe.
In astronomy, the terms object and body are often used interchangeably. 
However, an astronomical body or celestial body is a single, tightly bound, 
contiguous entity, while an astronomical or celestial object is a complex, 
less cohesively bound structure, which may consist of multiple bodies or even other objects with substructures.<br>
Examples of astronomical objects include planetary systems, star clusters, nebulae, 
and galaxies, while asteroids, moons, planets, and stars are astronomical bodies. 
A comet may be identified as both body and object: It is a body when referring to the frozen nucleus of ice and dust, 
and an object when describing the entire comet with its diffuse coma and tail.

<h3>Galaxy and larger</h3>
<p>
The universe can be viewed as having a hierarchical structure.
At the largest scales, the fundamental component of assembly is the galaxy.
Galaxies are organized into groups and clusters, often within larger superclusters,
that are strung along great filaments between nearly empty voids, forming a web that spans
the observable universe.
